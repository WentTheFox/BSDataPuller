# DataPuller
Gathers data about the current map you are playing to then be sent out over a websocket for other software to use, e.g. A web overlay like [BSDP-Overlay](https://github.com/ReadieFur/BSDP-Overlay). This mod works with multi PC setups!

## Installation:
To install this mod, download the [latest version](./releases/latest) and place the `DataPuller.dll` into your mods folder. Make sure to also have any of the dependencies listed below installed too.
### Dependencies, these can all be found on the [Mod Assistant](https://github.com/Assistant/ModAssistant) app:
In order for this mod to function properly you must have installed the following mods:
- [BSIPA ^4.3.3](https://github.com/bsmg/BeatSaber-IPA-Reloaded)
- [BeatSaverSharp ^3.4.5](https://github.com/Auros/BeatSaverSharper)

## Overlays:
There are few overlays that I know of at the moment that work with this mod but here are some:
| Overlay | Creator |
| --- | --- |
| [BSDP-Overlay](https://github.com/ReadieFur/BSDP-Overlay) | ReadieFur |
| [Freakylay](https://github.com/UnskilledFreak/Freakylay) | UnskilledFreak |

## Project status:
The [original repository](https://github.com/ReadieFur/BSDataPuller) has not been updated for over a year (at the time of writing) and appears to have been abandoned for all intents and purposes.

This fork is actively maintained by me ([DJDavid98](https://github.com/DJDavid98)) and new features/fixes are added on request to the best of my abilities.

Don't hesitate to open an issue or reach out in case you feel there is something that could be added/improved.

## Developer documentation:
### Obtaining the data via the Websocket:
Data is broadcasted over an unsecure websocket (plain `ws`) that runs on port `2946`, the path to the data is `/BSDataPuller/<TYPE>`.  
The reason for the use of an unsecure websocket is because it is pratically impossible to get a verified and signed SSL certificate for redistribution, that would break the whole point of SSL.  
Each endpoint will send out a JSON object, check [Data Types](#data-types) for the specific data that each endpoint sends out.

### Obtaining the data via the C#:
It is possible to use the data that this mod exposes within your own mod if you wish to do so.  
To get started, add the [latest version](./releases/latest) of the mod to your project as a reference.  
Data types can be accessed within the `DataPuller.Data` namespace.  
All data types extend the `AData` class which contains an `OnUpdate` event that can be subscribed to that is fired whenever the data is updated.  
Check [Data Types](#data-types) for the specific data that each endpoint sends out.

### Data types:
I will format each entry in the following way:
```
<TYPE>
	<DESCRIPTION>
	<LOCATION>
	<OBJECT>
		///<COMMENT>
		<TYPE> <NAME> = <DEFAULT_VALUE>;
```
All data types contain the following properties:
```cs
///The time that the data was serialized.
long UnixTimestamp;
```
Below is a list of all the specific data types:
